# Code-Echo
-This project is for building, flashing and monitoring executables applications for ESP-32 microcontrollers. So the 'Echo' stands for E in ESP.
-I am aiming at making abstraction layers for esp-idf components and make the application I want.
-My goal is making a running game in this 2 core, 500kb ram device.
