# Code-Echo
* This project is for building, flashing and monitoring executables applications for ESP-32 and other micro controllers. So the 'Echo' stands for E in ESP or Embedded.
* I am aiming at making abstraction layers for different external and internal components and make the application I want.
* My goal is making a running game in this 2 core, 500kb ram device.
* I will try to make this project as cross platform as I can and try to keep it simple. 
* I am using PlatformIO Arduino framework to develop projects.
