# Code-Echo
-This project is for building, flashing and monitoring executables applications for ESP-32 and other micro controllers. So the 'Echo' stands for E in ESP.
-I am aiming at making abstraction layers for different external and internal components and make the application I want.
-My goal is making a running game in this 2 core, 500kb ram device.
-I will try to make this project as cross platform as I can.
